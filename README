Hi, welcome to our election evote app.

To run our code:
(1) Open 'MySQL'. Create a database called 'erd2'.
(2) Then, with the database selected, run the included SQL code 'populate.sql'. This will populate your database with the right tables.
(3) Next, you will need to go into the java file 'DbAccessConfig'. In here you'll set up your credentials to access your MySQL database.
(4) Now simply run the main method of the 'WriteTest' class in the package 'edu.uga.cs.evote.test'. This will demonstrate a sample run of our code, and will populate the database you set up earlier.


What we implemented:
(1) Create 2 election officers
(2) Create an electoral district
(3) Create 2 voters so they belong to the district
(4) Create 2 political parties
(5) Create 2 ballots
(6) Create 3 issues
(7) Create 3 elections, one of each being partisan.
(8) Create 3 candidates for every election (18 total)

What we didn't implement:
(1) Creating the data to represent the voting of the 2 voters
(2) Cleanly deleting all the test data. However, to destroy all the data, simply drop the database and start at step one again!
